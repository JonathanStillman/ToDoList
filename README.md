## Overview
This application allows users to sign up with their own username / email / password for their account. This information will be stored in database, which in this case was being placed in [myphpadmin]. After a user signed into their account, they have access to writing their own todo list. Once the user has created their task, it will be placed in a table for them to see along with other tasks they might have saved before. This application also gives the user to either UPDATE or DELETE any tasks they choose and will be given an alert when this has successfully been accomplished.
